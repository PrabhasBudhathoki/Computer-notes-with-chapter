            <h2>Chapter 1: Database management system</h2>
            <p>The "Database Management" chapter in Grade 12 NEB introduces students to the basics of data handling and
                organization. It explains the role of a Database Management System (DBMS) in storing, managing, and
                retrieving data efficiently, and highlights the difference between data and information.</p>

            <p>Students also learn about relational databases, tables, and the use of SQL for managing data. The chapter
                covers essential commands like SELECT and INSERT, and introduces the concept of normalization to reduce
                data redundancy and improve consistency.</p>

                <h3>Data and Information</h3>
                <p>Data refers to raw facts and figures that have no meaning on their own. It can be in the form of
                    numbers, text, images, audio, or video. For example, a list of student names and their marks is
                    data.

                    There are different types of data such as numeric data, text data, date/time data, and boolean data.
                    Data is collected from various sources like forms, sensors, or online systems and is later processed
                    to generate useful information.

                    Good data should be accurate, relevant, complete, and timely. Only when data is processed and
                    analyzed does it become meaningful and help in decision-making. Thus, data plays a key role in
                    modern computer systems and database management.
                </p>
                <p>Information is processed or organized data that has meaning and is useful for decision-making. When
                    raw data is analyzed and presented in a structured way, it becomes information. For example, the
                    average marks of a student calculated from individual scores is information.

                    Information helps users understand patterns, solve problems, and make decisions. It adds context to
                    data and turns it into something meaningful. In a database system, data is stored so it can be
                    processed to produce useful information when needed.

                    Good information should be accurate, timely, complete, and relevant. Without information, raw data
                    has little value, which is why information is considered a valuable resource in both daily life and
                    business.

                <h3>Features of Information</h3>
                <p>Information has several important features that make it valuable and useful. First, it should be
                    accurate, meaning it must be free from errors and reliable. Without accuracy, decisions made using
                    the information can be wrong.
                </p>
                <p>Information should also be timely, available when needed to support quick and effective
                    decision-making. Completeness is another key feature — all necessary details must be included to
                    avoid misunderstandings. Additionally, information must be relevant, meaning it should be related
                    and useful to the specific purpose or problem.</p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, information should be understandable and consistent so that users can easily interpret it
                    without confusion. These features ensure that information helps individuals and organizations make
                    informed decisions.

                <h3>Database and Its Purpose</h3>
                <p>A database is an organized collection of related data that is stored electronically for easy access
                    and management. It helps store large amounts of information systematically so that users can
                    retrieve and update data efficiently.</p>

                <p>
                    The main purpose of a database is to provide a way to store data securely and reduce redundancy,
                    ensuring data accuracy and consistency. Databases support multiple users and applications, making it
                    easier to manage data in businesses, schools, banks, and many other organizations. Overall, a
                    database helps in organizing data so it can be turned into useful information quickly.

                <h3>Terminologies in Database:</h3>
                <h4>Table:</h4>
                <p>A table in a database is a collection of related data organized in rows and columns. Each table
                    represents a specific type of information, such as students or products. The columns in a table are
                    called fields, which define the different categories of data, like name, age, or price.</p>
                <h4>Field</h4>
                <p>A field is a single piece of data or a column in a database table. It represents one category or
                    attribute of the data, such as a person’s name, age, or phone number. Each field has a specific data
                    type and holds values for that attribute in every record of the table. Fields help organize data
                    clearly, making it easier to search and manage information within a database.</p>
                <h4>Record</h4>
                <p>A record is a complete set of fields that represent one item or entity in the table, such as all the
                    details of one student. In some database systems, a record is also called a tuple, which means a
                    single row of data containing values for each field.</p>
                <h4>Tuple</h4>
                <p>A tuple is another name for a single row or record in a database table. It represents one complete
                    set of related data values for all the fields in that table. For example, in a student table, one
                    tuple would contain all the information about one student, such as their ID, name, and marks. Tuples
                    help organize data into meaningful units within the database.


                </p>
                <h4>Object</h4>
                <p>An object is a concept from object-oriented databases, where data is stored as objects similar to
                    real-world entities. Objects combine both data and actions (methods) that can be performed on the
                    data.</p>

                <h4>Keys</h4>
                <p>Keys are special fields used to uniquely identify records in a table. A primary key ensures that each
                    record is unique, while a foreign key links one table to another, helping maintain relationships
                    between data in different tables.</p>

                <h4>Data Dictionary</h4>
                <p>A data dictionary is a collection of information about the data in a database, often called metadata.
                    It includes details such as the names, types, sizes, and relationships of data elements. It helps in
                    organizing, managing, and understanding the structure of the database, making it easier for users
                    and administrators to maintain consistency and avoid redundancy.

                <h3>Database Management System</h3>
                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>A Data Management System (DMS) is a software system that helps in storing, organizing, and managing
                    large amounts of data efficiently. It allows users to easily create, retrieve, update, and delete
                    data while ensuring data security, consistency, and integrity. DMS plays a vital role in handling
                    data systematically in various fields like business, education, and healthcare.

                </p>
                <h4>Objectives</h4>
                <p>The main objective of a Data Management System is to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently and securely. It aims to reduce data redundancy, ensure consistency, and provide controlled access to data for multiple users.

</p>
<h4>Advantages</h4>
<p>A Data Management System improves data sharing and accessibility, enhances security, reduces duplication, and ensures data integrity. It also supports backup and recovery, making data management more reliable and efficient.

</p>

<h4>Disadvantages</h4>
<p>A Data Management System improves data sharing and accessibility, enhances security, reduces duplication, and ensures data integrity. It also supports backup and recovery, making data management more reliable and efficient.

            <div class="question-box">
                <h3>Types of Database Model</h3>
                <p>There are four types of datatypes models:</p>
               <h4>1. Hierarchical database model </h4>
               <p>In the hierarchical model, data is organized in a tree-like structure where each record has a single parent and possibly many children. This model is simple and fast for operations that follow a fixed path but is not flexible for complex relationships.

</p>

<h4>2. Network Database Model</h4>
<p>The network model allows more complex relationships by organizing data in a graph structure. Records can have multiple parent and child records, making it more flexible than the hierarchical model but more difficult to design and manage.

</p>
<h4>3. Relational Database Model</h4>
<p>The relational model stores data in tables (called relations) with rows and columns. It is the most widely used model today due to its simplicity, flexibility, and use of SQL for querying data. It supports easy data manipulation and avoids redundancy.

</p>
<h4>4. Object-Oriented Database Model</h4>
<p>In this model, data is stored in the form of objects, similar to object-oriented programming. It supports complex data types and relationships, making it useful for applications that require multimedia or engineering data.

</p>
            </div>

            <div class="question-box">
                <h3>Integrity Constraints and types</h3><p>Integrity constraints are rules applied to database tables to maintain the accuracy and consistency of data. They ensure that the data entered into the database follows specific rules. The main types include:

</p>
<ol>
    <li>Primary Key Constraint – Ensures that each record has a unique identifier.

</li>
    <li>Foreign Key Constraint – Maintains referential integrity between related tables.

</li>
    <li>Not Null Constraint – Ensures that a field cannot have a NULL (empty) value.

</li>
    <li>Unique Constraint – Ensures all values in a column are unique.

</li>
<li>
    Check Constraint – Ensures that all values in a column meet a specific condition.

</li>
</ol>

            </div>
            <div class="question-box">
                <h3>Normalization</h3>
                <h4>a. Introduction</h4>
                <p>Normalization is a process in database design used to organize data efficiently by removing redundancy and ensuring data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between them. The goal is to minimize duplication and improve consistency.

                </p>
                <h4>b. Normal Forms</h4>
                <p>Normal forms are guidelines or rules used in the normalization process to organize database tables. Each normal form (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, etc.) addresses specific types of data anomalies and ensures higher levels of data integrity. As we move to higher normal forms, the structure becomes more refined and less redundant.

                </p>

                <h4>c. 1 NF, 2 NF, 3NF</h4>
                <p>First Normal form(1 NF): A table is in 1NF if all the values in each column are atomic (indivisible) and there are no repeating groups. It ensures that each column contains only one value per row.

                </p>
                <p>Second Normal form(2NF): A table is in 2NF if it is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key (no partial dependency). It applies mostly to tables with composite primary keys.



                </p>
                <p>Third Normal form(3 NF): A table is in 3NF if it is in 2NF and all non-key attributes are not transitively dependent on the primary key. This means non-key fields depend only on the key, not on other non-key fields.

                 </p>
                 <h4>d. Advantages:</h4>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Reduces data redundancy (no repeating data).

                </li>
                    <li>Ensures data integrity and consistency.

                </li>
                    <li>Makes updating data easier and more accurate.

                </li>
                    <li>Saves storage space by avoiding duplicate data.

                </li>
                    <li>Improves database organization and understanding.

                </li>
                 </ul>
                 <h4>e. Disadvantages:</h4>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Increases the number of tables, making queries more complex.

                </li>
                    <li>Requires more joins, which can reduce performance.

                </li>
                    <li>Slower data retrieval in some cases.

                </li>
                    <li>Difficult to design and manage for beginners.

                </li>
                    <li>Not always suitable for reporting and analytics.

                </li>
                 </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="question-box">
                <h3>Centralized and Distributed database</h3>
                <h4>1. Centralized Database</h4>
               
                    <p>A centralized database is stored in a single central server or location, and all users access data through a network. It is easy to manage, maintain, and secure since everything is in one place. However, it creates a dependency on one system — if the central server fails, the entire database becomes unavailable, and access speed may be slower for remote users.</p>
   
                <h4>Advantages:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Easy to manage and maintain.

                </li>
                    <li>Simple backup and recovery.

                </li>
                    <li>Strong data security in one location.

                </li>
                    <li>Consistent and accurate data.

                </li>
                    <li>Less hardware and software cost.

                </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Single point of failure.

</li>
                    <li>Heavy load on one server.



</li>
                    <li>Slower access for remote users.



</li>
                    <li>Network dependency.

</li>
                    <li>Limited scalability.

</li>

                </ul>

                <h4>2. Distributed Database</h4>
                <p>A distributed database is spread across multiple servers or locations but functions as a single system for users. Each site stores part of the data and may process queries locally. This increases reliability, fault tolerance, and speed for local users. However, it is more complex to manage, requires synchronization, and can have higher maintenance costs.

                </p>
                <h4>Advantages:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Faster access for local users.

                    </li>
                    <li>High reliability and availability.

</li>
                    <li>Continues working even if one site fails.

</li>
                    <li>Better scalability.

</li>
                    <li>Load is distributed across servers.

</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Complex system design and management.

</li>
                    <li>Expensive setup and maintenance.

</li>
                    <li>Difficult data synchronization.

</li>
                    <li>Security management is harder.

                <h3>Database Security</h3>
                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>Database security refers to the measures used to protect a database from unauthorized access, misuse, or theft. It ensures that only authorized users can access or modify data, keeping sensitive information safe. Security includes user authentication, access control, encryption, and regular backups to prevent data loss or breaches.</p>

                <h4>Challenges</h4>
                <p>Database security faces several challenges like unauthorized access, SQL injection attacks, and insider threats. Ensuring data privacy while allowing access to multiple users is complex. Managing strong authentication, encryption, and regular updates requires effort and expertise. Also, backup and disaster recovery need to be handled carefully to avoid data loss.

</p>
                <h4>Security measures</h4>
                <p>To protect data from unauthorized access and misuse, several security measures are implemented in database systems. User authentication using usernames and passwords ensures only authorized users can log in. Access control assigns specific permissions to different users, restricting who can read, write, or delete data. Data encryption is used to protect sensitive information during storage and transmission. Firewalls and intrusion detection systems help monitor and block suspicious activities. Regular backups and update patches are also essential to recover from system failures or security breaches. Together, these measures help maintain data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

                <h3>ER Diagrams</h3>
                <p>An ER Diagram is a visual representation of entities and the relationships between them in a database. It is used during the database design process to understand how data is connected and structured. In an ER diagram, entities are objects or things (like students or books) that can be identified distinctly. Attributes describe properties of an entity (e.g., a student has a name, ID, and address).</p>

                <h3>Data constraints</h3>
                <p>Data constraints are rules applied to columns in a table to ensure data accuracy and integrity. Some commonly used constraints are:</p>
                <ul>
                   <li>NOT NULL: Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL (empty) value.</li> 

<li>UNIQUE: Ensures all values in a column are different.</li>

<li>PRIMARY KEY: A combination of NOT NULL and UNIQUE. It uniquely identifies each record in a table.</li>

<li>AUTO INCREMENT: Automatically increases the value of a numeric field (usually for primary keys) whenever a new record is inserted.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>AND: Returns rows when all conditions are true (e.g., WHERE age > 18 AND gender = 'Male').</li>

                    <li>OR: Returns rows when at least one condition is true (e.g., WHERE city = 'Kathmandu' OR city = 'Lalitpur').</li>

<p><b>1. INNER JOIN:</b> Returns only the records that have matching values in both tables.

<pre>
    SELECT students.name, books.title
    FROM students
    INNER JOIN books ON students.id = books.student_id;</pre></p>


<p><b>2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN):</b> Returns all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table. Unmatched records from the right table will have NULL values.
<pre>
    SELECT students.name, books.title
    FROM students
    LEFT JOIN books ON students.id = books.student_id;</pre>
</p>


<p><b>3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN):</b> Returns all records from the right table and the matched records from the left table. Unmatched records from the left table will have NULL values.
